# BlenderSvgToMesh

Blender project with script that will convert a colour coded SVG image into a mesh which could then be imported into a game engine for use as a level.

## Quick Start

To test the capabilities of this project, simply open in blender and run the script (Click "Run Script").  You should see a 3D level in the viewport which you can take a look around using fly mode (Shift + `).

[You can see an example of what this will look like when imported into Unreal Engine 4 by clicking here. Please note that this mesh was simply imported, no lightmaps have been built etc.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gl5w1ps3icps7k/levelmeshtest%20-%20Unreal%20Editor%202020-07-26%2017-32-12.mp4?dl=0)

## Notes

This is a work in progress and as such will contain bugs and is quite limited in functionality.
