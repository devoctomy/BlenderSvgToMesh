# BlenderSvgToMesh

Blender project with script that will convert a colour coded SVG image into a mesh which could then be imported into a game engine for use as a level.

## Quick Start

To test the capabilities of this project, simply open in blender and run the script (Click "Run Script").  You should see a 3D level in the viewport which you can take a look around using fly mode (Shift + `).

## Notes

This is a work in progress and as such will contain bugs and is quite limited in functionality.
